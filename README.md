This feature allows users to search up athletes on the web app and filter their results

### Insights
![Insights](/imgs/Insights.gif)
There are two main components to this. Right under the summary heading, there will be 3 tags indicating the athlete's best stroke, preferred swimming style, and best event. Below, there will be a radar and stacked area graph. The radar graph demonstrates the athlete's performance over the 4 strokes. The stacked area graph displays the athlete's growth overtime based on an event.

### Data Table
